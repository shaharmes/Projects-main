                <li><u>Description:</u>
                    <br>A thief who steals corporate secrets through the use of dream-sharing technology
                    <br>is given the inverse task of planting an idea into the mind of a C.E.O.,
                    <br>but his tragic past may doom the project and his team to disaster.
                </li><hr>
                <li><u>Why I like the movie</u>:
                    <br>Inception is absolutely a movie with it's own set of flaws, but what made it feel like such a
                    <br>revolutionary and thrilling film is the fact that it is just a very smart concept and execution,
                    <br>and it shamelessly relies on it's audience to be smart enough to understand everything that's going on too
                </li><hr>
                <li><u>Favorite quote:</u><br>"You musn't be afraid to dream a little bigger, darling."
                    <br> - Christopher Nolan

                <li><u>South Africa:</u>
                    <br>South Africa is a country on the southernmost tip of the African continent,
                    <br>marked by several distinct ecosystems. Inland safari destination Kruger National Park
                    <br>is populated by big game. The Western Cape offers beaches, lush winelands around Stellenbosch
                    <br>and Paarl, craggy cliffs at the Cape of Good Hope, forest and lagoons along the Garden Route,
                    <br>and the city of Cape Town, beneath flat-topped Table Mountain. The country is also known for its
                    <br>diverse wildlife, like lions and leopards.

                <li><u>Why I like it:</u>
                    <br>South Africa is a country with a lot of diversity, nature, and history.
                    <br>And it's a country that I would love to visit again in the future.
